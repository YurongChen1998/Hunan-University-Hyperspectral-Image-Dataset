# HVAD-Hyperspectral-Vaccine-Anomaly-Detection-dataset

Hyperspectral imaging takes a key part of machine vision. It has been widely used in various applications, such as remote sensing, biotechnology, food inspection.
With the effort of researchers and developers, there are [some public hyperspectral datasets](http://www.ehu.eus/ccwintco/index.php/Hyperspectral_Remote_Sensing_Scenes).

However, we note that the pharmaceutical hyperspectral imaging dataset is absent. Hyperspectral data can provide significant information of medicinal products.
Here, we public a hyperspectral imaging dataset for vaccine anomaly detection task.
